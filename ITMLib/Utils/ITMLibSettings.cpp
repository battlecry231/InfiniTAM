	deltaRadius_                  The maximum fraction by which a new surfel can have a larger radius than the surfel into which it is being fused if full fusion is to occur.
    gaussianConfidenceSigma_      The sigma value for the Gaussian used when calculating the sample confidence.
    maxMergeAngle_                The maximum angle allowed between the normals of a pair of surfels if they are to be merged.
    maxMergeDist_                 The maximum distance allowed between a pair of surfels if they are to be merged.
    maxSurfelRadius_              The maximum radius a surfel is allowed to have.
    minRadiusOverlapFactor_       The minimum factor by which the radii of a pair of surfels must overlap if they are to be merged.
    stableSurfelConfidence_       The confidence value a surfel must have in order for it to be considered "stable".
    supersamplingFactor_          The factor by which to supersample (in each axis) the index image used for finding surfel correspondences.
    trackingSurfelMaxDepth_       The maximum depth a surfel must have in order for it to be used for tracking.
    trackingSurfelMinConfidence_  The minimum confidence value a surfel must have in order for it to be used for tracking.
    unstableSurfelPeriod_         The number of time steps a surfel is allowed to be unstable without being updated before being removed.
    unstableSurfelZOffset_        The z offset to apply to unstable surfels when trying to ensure that they are only rendered if there is no stable alternative.
    useGaussianSampleConfidence_  Whether or not to use a Gaussian-weighted sample confidence as described in the Keller paper.
    useSurfelMerging_             Whether or not to use surfel merging.
